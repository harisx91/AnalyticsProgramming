## M11-Muscle Builder: Data Visualization

### In this Module we are going to:
* Take the data from previos module, and run some visulization using plotly or Bokeh. 
* First I am going to group the data in categories so it is easier to run the data, and then I am going to take that data and make it user interactive where user can Zoom in on the data itself. 
* Secondly, I am going to run Bokeh visualization using the group of my data.

Conclusion: I was able to both visualize using the data of how long it takes to close the Violation Ticket in each Borough by both Plotly and Bokeh Visualization .
