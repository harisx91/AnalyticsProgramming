### In this Project:
* We are going to take the data from (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/2r9r-m6j4.csv), and choose a variable that is within the data like "boro" and run some aggregation on it. 
* Then I am going to group the ViolationIb by each Borough, to see run the analysis to count the numbers by each Borough.
* Finally, I am going to check to see which Borough takes the longest to close the Violations. 
* I am going to graph the chart, using the Bar Chart to make it easier for viewer to Analyze the data.
