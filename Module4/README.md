##Module_4 : NYC Water Consumption

In this module we are going to import data from the CSV file stored in Resources folder of this Notebook, and we are going to answer questions like:
* Finding out the Maximum value of NYC Water Consumption
* How many years are within the data
* Finding out both the mean and standard deviation for the data 
* Looking for differences in population from year to year
* Creating arrays and finding out which data type are they
* Finally, verifying that "Vectorized Operations" are faster than both loop and list comprehension

1.I am working on this data set to determine the water consumption over 40 years and how it changes based on the city population to get a pattern.

2.The data set includes 40 rows and 4 columns; Year(from 1976 to 2019), New york city population, NYC consumption(million gallons per day), Per capita(Gallons Per person per year) and it is taken from NYCOpenData.

3.Here is the link of the data set;

4.This notebook contains both the CSV file and the notebook analyzing it.
