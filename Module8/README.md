### In this Project:
* Usin pandas to ingest and select some data from my final project dataset
* Clean up the data; drop any unnecessary columns along with renaming the columns. 
* We are going to change the data type.
* Dropping any Nan values found in the dataset
* Data was collected from (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/wvxf-dwi5.csv)

### Conclusion: In the process of data cleaning, there were unnecessary columns that were dropped and all the NaN values were dropped as well for better data analysis. I also changed the named of the columns to make them more presentable and changed few datatype on dataset for easier future data analysis.
