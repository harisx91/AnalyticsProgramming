## 10/20/2019

### In this Project:
* Usin pandas to ingest and select some data from my final project dataset
* Clean up the data; drop any unnecessary columns along with renaming the columns. 
* Data was collected from (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/wvxf-dwi5.csv)
* Using matplotlib, pandas and seaborn to visualize data, and compare how data could correlate visually 

### In this module, I was able to find out that Brooklyn has the highest number of Violations and Staten Island has the lowest number of Violations BUT Staten Island takes the longest to close the violation tickets.
